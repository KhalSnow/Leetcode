Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within 
the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’2^31,  2^31 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, 
assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
